## Building
Note: This module lists `npm-run-all` as a dev dependency, and uses it for commands such as `run-s test` and `run-s build start`, which are substitutes for `npm run test` and `npm run build && npm run start` respectively.  You can learn more at the [npm-run-all npm page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all).

 - `run-s build` - Build the code and public assets into the `/dist` folder
 - `run-s start` - Run the live version of the website for development
 - `run-s test` - Run the mocha tests
